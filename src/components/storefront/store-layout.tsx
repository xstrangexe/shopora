/**
 * Shared storefront chrome.
 *
 * Applied per route rather than through a pathless layout route, so a new page
 * has to opt in explicitly. A page that renders without the header is then a
 * visible omission in review rather than a silent inheritance bug.
 *
 * `page-bottom-pad` keeps page content clear of the fixed bottom bar on mobile;
 * the bar is hidden at 1024px and above. Product pages pass `bottomNav={false}`
 * because their own "order now" bar takes that place.
 *
 * There is no cart drawer: buyers order from the product page. The cart code
 * stays in the project only for the old /checkout page.
 *
 * Always light: `data-theme="light"` re-scopes the tokens, so a dark choice made
 * with the admin sidebar's toggle never turns the shop dark for its owner.
